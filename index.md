### Favorite Labs

* LAB 1

Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because throughout the week I learned so much information about C++ and its language. I learned how to use Java in my senior year of high school and switching over to C++ was a challenge. But this was a fun challenge that I was willing to push through. It was also the first time that I was pushed to program with another person, so it was fun to learn with someone else!

* LAB 4

Lab 4 in its entirety was also one of my favorites because it was the first time that me and my partner did some intense debugging. I remember that we were so fixated on making the code to work line by line just to figure out that there was a typo within part 1! It was truly a humbling experience and helped me improve on my debugging skills.

* LAB 7

Lab 7, part 2 was also one of my favorites because we were actually putting our coding skills to real-world applications. I love the game Blackjack and to break down the game into its most basic functions and rebuilding it from scratch using code was fun and challenging! I hope to do more labs such as that in any future coding classes that I may take throughout my time here in CSUF!
